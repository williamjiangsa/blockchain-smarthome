# blockchain-smarthome


Blockchain-based smart home architecture.


Two same smart contract running both inside the house and outside the house, two blockchian is synced automatically.


The controller APP is written by Fullter, the controller can interact with smart contract both inside the house and outside the house.


The architecutre is proved to be feasible, however, with the initial configuration of Ethereum private blockchain setup, the performance of the system is not good enough. So, at the second part of the project, the evaluation tools are developed to figure out which part occupy the main delay in the process. According to the delay analysis, come up with corresponding solution, the result is great after improvement.
